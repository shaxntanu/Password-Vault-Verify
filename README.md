# Password-Vault-Verify
This C program simulates a vault password system allowing a user up to 5 attempts to enter the correct password. It prompts for password input, tracks attempts, grants access if correct, and locks the vault after 5 failed tries. Ideal for learning input validation and loops in C programming.
